What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My work on the project has helped me develop a stronger ability to plan and construct 3D scenes by thoughtfully selecting textures, materials, and lighting setups to enhance realism. I have also improved my skills in breaking down complex visual designs into manageable components and implementing them systematically in code.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
For my project, I followed an iterative design process that started with researching reference images, sketching out a scene layout, and then incrementally building and testing each element in OpenGL. I regularly refined textures, object placement, and lighting based on visual feedback and functionality until I approached the desired result.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics from my design approach—such as breaking down complex scenes into smaller, manageable components, using visual references, and continually testing and refining can be applied to future projects to ensure systematic progress and higher quality outcomes. This iterative process helps catch issues early and allows for creative adjustments throughout development.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene, I adopted strategies such as modular coding for reusable components, utilizing texture mapping for realistic surfaces, and leveraging reference images to guide object placement and proportions. I also experimented with iterative testing and incremental integration to ensure each scene element rendered as intended before moving on to the next.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential to my development process, as I regularly refined my models, textures, and lighting setups based on how the scene appeared during each test render. By repeatedly tweaking and reevaluating individual elements, I was able to steadily improve the realism and cohesiveness of the 3D scene.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach to developing code has become more structured and methodical throughout the milestones, as I learned to break complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and focus on modular, reusable components. This evolution helped me organize my work more efficiently, catch errors sooner, and ultimately build a more robust and maintainable project.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me valuable knowledge of how to represent complex data and environments visually, helping me better understand the relationship between mathematics, programming, and user experience. These skills are directly applicable to future coursework or projects involving simulations, game development, or any field that requires intuitive visual representation of information.
